# Vision

## Purpose

Provide a production-grade engineering portfolio that communicates measurable engineering rigor, deterministic behavior, and auditability to technical employers and reviewers.

## Target audience

- Hiring engineers and engineering managers evaluating technical depth.
- Senior technical interviewers and design reviewers assessing system decisions.
- Recruiters and technical program leads seeking clear, auditable signals of engineering competence.

## Core principles

- Swiss design discipline: strict grid, typographic hierarchy, and restrained visual language.
- Restraint and clarity: prioritize information density and legibility over ornamentation.
- Component-driven, server-first UI: predictable rendering and minimal client-side mutation.
- Auditability: content provenance traceable to file-based sources and Git history.
- Employer readability: content and metadata organized for rapid technical review.

## What this project is not

- Not a marketing or personal-brand site focused on visual spectacle.
- Not an experimental playground for unvetted libraries or frameworks.
- Not a feature-rich application; feature additions must serve evaluation and evidence goals.

## Long-term evolution expectations

- Incremental, backward-compatible improvements that preserve determinism and audit trails.
- Prioritize testability, observability, and maintainability over visual features.
- Any change that affects locked technical decisions requires an explicit architectural revision.
- No feature promises; evolution is conservative and governed by constraints.
